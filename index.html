          <p>That's all it took for me to rethink our relationship. To rethink all the times I would become so enraged, seeing through the ways in which you tried to shield me from the harm you brought upon us. You stood in front of our crumbling household, trying to pull the wool over my eyes so I would spend my time being a teenager instead of worrying about a family’s finances. Last year was the hardest, you were laid off, unemployment wasn’t coming through, and I was working three jobs to try to make things better for myself. I feel embarrassed now to have thought of you as a sitting duck, so blindly waiting for some miracle to occur. All this feels futile now that I consider you might not come back.</p>
          <p>I would rethink the bond between mother and daughter, one which is equally nurturing as it is suffocating. I would call every night, speaking to your comatose self on the other end, hoping for that brilliant subconscious of yours to make sense of the words floating in, intermingling with the soft hum of hospital machinery. </p>
